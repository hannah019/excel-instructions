## README

These instructions are designed to familiarize a basic computer user to the basics of using Microsoft Excel. The user will learn how to navigate the software, design formulas and use functions, and perform simple data analysis using sorting, formatting, and inserting charts or graphs on the spreadsheet. The authors of these instructions used Version 2103 of Excel 2019, part of the Office 365 Suite of applications.

The authors relied on online tutorials on using markdown (such as https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to draft the instructions.
