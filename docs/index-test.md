## Troubleshooting

Here is a list of the most common errors you may encounter in Excel and the suggested causes and solutions to the problems.

*	**The formula is not calculating and the cell is displaying the formula as text.** 
 All formulas must start with an “=” for Excel to compute the formula.
 
*	**#DIV/0 is showing in cell.** 
 This error happens when the cell is has numbers dividing by 0.

*	**#NAME? is showing in cell.** 
 There is something that Excel does not recognize. Check that the standard Excel function is spelled correctly. 

*	**####### is shown.** 
 The cell is physically too narrow to display the entire value. Make the cell wider.

*	**#REF! is shown.** 
 A cell reference e.g. A1, in your formula has been deleted. Revise your formula to have a new cell reference in place or eliminate the need for the reference altogether.
