## Navigation introduction

```yaml
This page will give a gentle introduction to navigating Excel - namely the splash page and home page.
```

## Splash page


 When you launch Excel, you are met with the following page:
 
 ![splash page](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/navigation_image1.png?raw=true)
    
The top bar allows you to quickly create a new document. The first option on the left will create a new blank spreadsheet, and the options to the right are a basic Excel introduction (recommended for absolute beginners) and tutorials for various Excel features. Clicking on More templates will provide you with various skeleton files - handy when you want to quickly launch many kinds of charts and graphs.
    
Below the top bar you will find the search bar. The search bar is useful for finding a specific document when the name is known. 
    
Below the search bar are 3 options to find files when the name is not known. The first is Recent. Recent shows you your mostly recently used files, in descending order. Clicking on More workbooks will allow you to go back even further in time.
    
Pinned allows you to access files that you have pinned. Pinning a file marks it as one of your favourites and allows you to quickly access it next time. Pinning is a great option when you won't use a file on a regular basis, but the file needs to be found quickly and easily when it is needed. 
    
To pin a file, find it (either through the Search bar or through the Recent tab), right click it, then click on "Pin to list".

![right click to pin](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/navigation_image2.png?raw=true)
 
 Your file will now immediately appear under the Pinned tab.
 
![pinned tab selected](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/navigation_image3.png?raw=true)
    
Shared with Me will show you documents that have been specifically shared with you. This allows you to more easily sort out documents that are part of a team effort.
    

### Home

The Home tab is the default tab when you launch Excel. If you wish to return to it, simply look at the top left of the Splash page. Home the very first tab.

![home tab highlighted in top left](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/0bc88c2ce9c5050c778fb2b0848068713f35fdbe/assets/images/navigation_image4.png?raw=true)


### New

The New tab is located on the upper-left side of the splash page, below the Home tab. The New tab is used when you wish to create a brand-new document. You are able to create more than just a blank document:  the New tab will provide you with several template options. Should you desire a template that isn't under the new tab, you can use the search bar to search for a more specialized template. Excel even provides suggested search terms to get you started.

Here's an example of a search for a template that will help us track our monthly food expenses:
![search for custom template](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/59ca59f1b141d4478f6b979cd1520df220a8c551/assets/images/navigation_image5.png?raw=true)

Press enter and your search results will be ready.

![part 2 select custom template based on search results](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/48b3d1cfa5690fe5300d1b1d8b1715a3f2eb5091/assets/images/navigation_image6.png?raw=true)

### Open

Open is on the splash page, on the upper-left side. Open can be found directly under New. Open allows you to open a folder or workspace by finding it manually on your computer. 
Clicking on Browse will open up your Explorer, where you can navigate your Computer's file hierarchy and manually select the document you wish to open.

The Open tab even supports opening documents that are Cloud-based (stored on the internet, not physically on your machine)

### Info

```yaml
The info tab does much more than simply provide info and deserves an investigation!
```

The info tab's primary purpose is to provide information about the document, as the name suggests.

The right side of the Info tab will tell you when the document was created, who created it, and when the document was last changed.
It also tells you the size of the file and allows you to categorize your file.

**The info tab has its own important functionalities, however:**

- The Protect Workbook option will control who can make what changes on your file. If you do not use this feature, anyone who has access to viewing the document can make changes to it. Someone can (through accident or through malice) erase all your data and hard-work!
![protect workbook selected](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/ac1ea39c96afd81148ae73936f4fcb71662e228e/assets/images/navigation_image7.png?raw=true)
- Inspect Workbook looks over your shoulder and protects you from things you might have missed. For example, Inspect Workbook can tell you when your file will leak personal information, or if your Excel file will not be compatible with different versions of Excel.
- Version History is Excel's internal version of version control. If you make a change that you want to revert (wrong data or the file stopped working after a change) then Version History will help you go back to an earlier version. **Note that you must sign in for your change history to be logged**

![turn on version history to track change history](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/21b2cdccaf3af5af5a93e1b39276c1746b800de9/assets/images/navigation_image8.png?raw=true)
- Manage Workbooks deals with current and very recent Excel files. It will allow you to recover or delete current unsaved workbooks. Note that unsaved files will not be accessable for very long before they are lost forever, if you need to keep a file then save it to guarantee you will be able to access it in the future.
- Browser view options control how your Excel file will look on internet browsers as well as control which cells can be modified via a browser.                    



### Save / Save As

Clicking on Save will quickly save the document, with no further action required on your part. The file will be saved in the same place with the same name as the previous version.

Save As allows you to save the document in a new place or with a new name. Both the new version and the previous versions will exist as 2 separate documents after selecting "Save As".

### Print

Print allows you to send your files to a printer. On this tab you can also change options for printing (printing specific pages, printing single of double sided, adjusting the margins etc.)

The Print tab does not only convert physical printing, it also includes functions such as "print to .pdf" which will convert your Excel file to a .pdf and then save it. This is an easy and convenient way of converting your file format.

### Share

The Share tab allows you to share your Excel files with another user digitally. Think of it as similar to a link to a website.

### Export

Export is another way of allowing you to create a .pdf/xps document. This tab also allows you to change the file format of the current document.

### Publish

Publish will Publish your document to Power BI, a business analytics tool made by Microsoft. To use this feature, you must be signed into your Power BI account.

![link power bi account](https://github.com/hannah019/excel-instructions/blob/caadbcf471cad7bf013eb2983817a8a4abaebada/assets/images/navigation_image9.png?raw=true)


### Close

Close will close the current file. Be careful pressing this tab because there is no prompt and the file closes immediately.

### Account

Account provides information about your Microsoft 365 account. You can edit your privacy and change Excel visual themes and backgrounds. The Account tab also provides updates about Microsoft products (Excel, Word and Powerpoint, among others)


### Feedback

Feedback allows you to tell Microsoft whether you like or dislike a specific feature. It also allows you to write to Microsoft if you want to suggest a specific feature.

### Options
Options provides an entire suite of configurations. If an issue wasn't covered above, there's a good chance that it's in options.

If you are having trouble, see [Troubleshooting](https://hannah019.github.io/excel-instructions/docs/index-test/)

## File

Clicking on File will return you to the splash page. For information on how to navigate in the splash page, please see the above section on this page.

## Home

Home includes the most common options for Excel, such as changing the colour and size of text. It also includes cell formatting options (adding, deleting or merging cells)

## Insert

Insert allows you to place tables, charts and shapes into your Excel file. You can also insert links and comments.

## Page Layout

Page layout deals with big picture visual settings relating to the page. You can change the colour of the page itself as well as the height and weight.

You can even insert backgrounds and page breaks.

## Formulas

The formulas section is critical for inserting logic into your document. For further information on some of the most important Excel functions, please see the Formulas and Functions page.

## Data

The Data section allows you to group and analyze large amounts of information at one time. You can insert data from files either locally or on the cloud. You can sort and filter data, and even create a forcast based on your current data.

## Review

The Review section helps you polish off your Excel workbook. In addition to spelling and grammar checks, the Review tab provides references to a thesaurus, statistics and a translator. The Review tab also allows you to check the accessibility of the workbook to ensure that everyone can interact with your sheets.

## View

The View tab deals with how the cells are viewed. An important feature that many people neglect is the Freeze Panes feature. If you elect to freeze some cells they will always be visible, no matter where you scroll! This allows you to keep certain pieces of information on the screen while you freely move about the rest of the sheet.

## Help

The Help tab gives you more information about Excel and allows you to troubleshoot your problems. The Help tab even includes links to external support, in case you need to speak to a real person.

## QuickBooks

Quickbooks provides integration with the QuickBooks suite of programs. QuickBooks is accounting software and allows more sophisticated tools for those using Excel for financial and accounting purposes.
