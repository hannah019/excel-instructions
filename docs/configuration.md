## Navigation introduction

```yaml
This page will give a gentle introduction to navigating Excel - namely the splash page and home page.
```

## Splash page


 When you launch Excel, you are met with the following page: 
 
 ![splash page](https://github.com/Ryanwo1/Rykyha/blob/48e237b8699b45b5360eb95e392d0d15108b76a6/assets/images/navigation_image1.png?raw=true)
    
The top bar allows you to quickly create a new document. The first option on the left will create a new blank spreadsheet, and the options to the right are a basic Excel introduction (recommended for absolute beginners) and tutorials for various Excel features. Clicking on More templates will provide you with various skeleton files - handy when you want to quickly launch many kinds of charts and graphs.
    
Below the top bar you will find the search bar. The search bar is useful for finding a specific document when the name is known. 
    
Below the search bar are 3 options to find files when the name is not known. The first is Recent. Recent shows you your mostly recently used files, in descending order. Clicking on More workbooks will allow you to go back even further in time.
    
Pinned allows you to access files that you have pinned. Pinning a file marks it as one of your favourites and allows you to quickly access it next time. Pinning is a great option when you won't use a file on a regular basis, but the file needs to be found quickly and easily when it is needed. 
    
To pin a file, find it (either through the Search bar or through the Recent tab), right click it, then click on "Pin to list".

![right click to pin](https://github.com/Ryanwo1/Rykyha/blob/bde419d089a41b70f31dfd2b6aee0a783cfdf703/assets/images/navigation_image2.png?raw=true)
 
 Your file will now immediately appear under the Pinned tab.

Shared with Me will show you documents that have been specifically shared with you. This allows you to more easily sort out documents that are part of a team effort.
    

## Home

The Home tab is the default tab when you launch Excel. If you wish to return to it, simply look at the top left of the Splash page. Home the very first tab.


## New

The New tab is located on the upper-left side of the splash page, below the Home tab. The New tab is used when you wish to create a brand-new document. You are able to create more than just a blank document:  the New tab will provide you with several template options. Should you desire a template that isn't under the new tab, you can use the search bar to search for a more specialized template. Excel even provides suggested search terms to get you started.

## Open

Open is on the splash page, on the upper-left side. Open can be found directly under New. Open allows you to open a folder or workspace by finding it manually on your computer. 
Clicking on Browse will open up your Explorer, where you can navigate your Computer's file hierarchy and manually select the document you wish to open.

The Open tab even supports opening documents that are Cloud-based (stored on the internet, not physically on your machine)

## Info

```yaml
The info tab does much more than simply provide info and deserves an investigation!
```

The info tab's primary purpose is to provide information about the document, as the name suggests.

The right side of the Info tab will tell you when the document was created, who created it, and when the document was last changed.
It also tells you the size of the file and allows you to categorize your file.

**The info tab has its own important functionalities, however:**

- The Protect Workbook option will control who can make what changes on your file. If you do not use this feature, anyone who has access to viewing the document can make changes to it. Someone can (through accident or through malice) erase all your data and hard-work!
- Inspect Workbook looks over your shoulder and protects you from things you might have missed. For example, Inspect Workbook can tell you when your file will leak personal information, or if your Excel file will not be compatible with different versions of Excel.
- Version History is Excel's internal version of version control. If you make a change that you want to revert (wrong data or the file stopped working after a change) then Version History will help you go back to an earlier version. **Note that you must sign in for your change history to be logged**
- Manage Workbooks deals with current and very recent Excel files. It will allow you to recover or delete current unsaved workbooks. Note that unsaved files will not be accessable for very long before they are lost forever, if you need to keep a file then save it to guarantee you will be able to access it in the future.
- Browser view options control how your Excel file will look on internet browsers as well as control which cells can be modified via a broswer.                       - 



## Save / Save As

Clicking on Save will quickly save the document, with no further action required on your part. The file will be saved in the same place with the same name as the previous version.

Save as allows you to save the document in a new place or with a new name. Both the new version and the previous versions will exist as 2 separate documents after selecting "Save As"

## Print

Print allows you to send your files to a printer. On this tab you can also change options for printing (printing specific pages, printing single of double sided, adjusting the margins etc.)

The Print tab does not only convert physical printing, it also includes functions such as "print to .pdf" which will convert your Excel file to a .pdf and then save it. This is an easy and convenient way of converting your file format.

## Share

The Share tab allows you to share your Excel files with another user digitally. Think of it as a link, like to a website.

## Export

Export is another way of allowing you to create a .pdf/xps document. This tab also allows you to change the file format of the current document.

## Publish

Publish will Publish your document to Power BI, a business analytics tool made by Microsoft. To use this feature, you must be signed into your Power BI account. More information is available in the Troubleshooting section

## Close

Close will close the current file. Be careful pressing this tab because there is no prompt and the file closes immediately.

## Account

Account provides information about your Microsoft 365 account. You can edit your privacy and change Excel visual themes and backgrounds. The Account tab also provides updates about Microsoft products (Excel, Word and Powerpoint, among others)


## Feedback

Feedback allows you to tell Microsoft whether you like or dislike a specific feature. It also allows you to write to Microsoft if you want to suggest a specific feature.

## Options
Options provides an entire suite of configurations. If an issue wasn't covered above, there's a good chance that it's in options.
