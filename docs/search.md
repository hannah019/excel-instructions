Here you will find definitions to technical terms you may encounter throughout the guide.

* document - Document and file are used interchangably throughout this file. A document typically refers to an individual group of Excel tabs - you work in 1 document at a time.
*	file – A file refers less to the content of an Excel workbook and is more about the technical implementation of the worksheet (for example, you can send your Excel file over e-mail).
* argument – the actual values passed into a function.
*	parameter – the values the function is designed to accept.
*	function - A function is a tool that takes a set of input and returns a value. The transformation of data depends on what the specific function does
*	formula - A mathematical blueprint that solves a given problem.
*	number - Number follows the common English use of the word. Numbers are divided into 2 types: whole numbers (numbers that do not contain a dot) and decimal. Please note that formatted dates are not numbers, even though they contain numbers.
*	array –  An array is a collection of multiple values all combined into 1 object. Combining the values into 1 object allows certain functions to be used on larger amounts of data.
* logical test - A logical test is when Excel checks whether or not a condition is true. If the condition is true, the logical test will return true. Otherwise, it will return false.
