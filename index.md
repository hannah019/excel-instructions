## Introduction

### Preface

Microsoft Excel (MS Excel) is a popular industry-standard spreadsheet program for performing calculations and organizing and analyzing data. You can find people using Excel at work, school, or for various personal tasks (personal finances, impromptu calculations, etc.). 

### Goals and Intended Audience

This guide is for basic computer users who had little or no exposure to MS Excel. The guide will build a solid base of knowledge so the reader may investigate more advanced topics in the future. Excel is a powerful program with an extensive list of features and functionality. Advanced topics such as Pivot tables and Microsoft Visual Basic will not be covered. By the end of this guide, you will know how to:

•	navigate the program features
•	use formulas and functions
•	perform simple data analysis
